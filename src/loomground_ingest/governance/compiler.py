"""Governance policy ingest → digital twin.

A user pastes their AI policy; the compiler builds the governance graph + paths +
the host to-do list around it. The deterministic core uses deontic cues so the
same policy always yields the same twin (gated by a golden fixture, LLM off); an
optional, injected LLM proposer is opt-in enrichment, never the source of truth.

Pipeline (the loomground-skill litmus): extract → classify express/policy/host →
draft a v0.5 .lg patch from the express set → validate fail-closed
(loomground-solver) → return the twin. It DECLARES governance; it does not certify
compliance (no score) and nothing is written to the chain — the caller confirms,
and that confirm is the auto-instrumented write.

Dependency wiring: parsing/validation/projection are supplied directly by
``loomground-solver`` (which consumes the neutral artifacts published by
``loomground-governance``). The LLM path is an injection seam only —
``set_default_proposer`` or the per-call ``llm_proposer=`` argument — so the
deterministic path carries zero LLM dependency and a host owns any model route.
